üîê Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
üìå Introduction
This project demonstrates image encryption using pixel manipulation by swapping and modifying pixel values. Instead of traditional cryptographic methods, we use XOR operations to scramble pixel data, making the image unreadable until it is decrypted using the same technique.

This method is useful for:
‚úî Basic image obfuscation for privacy protection
‚úî Custom encryption experiments in cybersecurity research
‚úî Understanding pixel-level image transformations

The encryption is reversible, meaning the same script can restore the original image.

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code
1Ô∏è‚É£ Load the Image
We use the Pillow (PIL) library to open an image file and convert it into a NumPy array. This allows us to manipulate pixel values directly.

python
Copy
Edit
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# Load the image
img = Image.open("input.jpg")  # Load the target image
img_array = np.array(img)  # Convert image to a NumPy array
2Ô∏è‚É£ Encrypt the Image (Pixel Manipulation)
We use XOR encryption with a numeric key to scramble pixel values.

‚úî Why XOR?

It‚Äôs a lightweight encryption technique used in cryptography.

The same operation can both encrypt and decrypt the image.

python
Copy
Edit
key = 42  # Encryption key (must be the same for decryption)
encrypted_array = img_array ^ key  # XOR each pixel with the key
Each pixel‚Äôs RGB value is modified by XORing it with the key (42), making the image unrecognizable.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Save the Encrypted Image
We convert the modified array back into an image and save it as encrypted.png.

python
Copy
Edit
output_image = Image.fromarray(encrypted_array)  # Convert back to image
output_filename = "encrypted.png"
output_image.save(output_filename)  # Save encrypted image

print(f"Image saved as {output_filename}")
At this point, the image is encrypted and cannot be understood visually.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Decrypt the Image (Reversing the Process)
To decrypt, we simply run the same XOR operation again. Since XOR is reversible, applying the same key restores the original pixel values.

python
Copy
Edit
decrypted_array = encrypted_array ^ key  # XOR again with the same key
decrypted_image = Image.fromarray(decrypted_array)  # Convert back to image
decrypted_image.save("decrypted.png")  # Save decrypted image
‚úî Why does this work?
XORing a value twice with the same key returns the original value:

Copy
Edit
(A XOR K) XOR K = A
‚úî Example:
If a pixel has a value of 200, and we XOR it with 42:

Copy
Edit
200 XOR 42 = 226  (encrypted value)
226 XOR 42 = 200  (decrypted value)
This ensures that the encryption is perfectly reversible.

üì¢ Final Notes
‚úî This project demonstrates pixel manipulation encryption using XOR operations.
‚úî The same script encrypts and decrypts the image when run twice.
‚úî You can change the encryption key to make the encryption more secure.
‚úî This method is not suitable for strong security applications but is a great learning tool for image processing and encryption basics.
